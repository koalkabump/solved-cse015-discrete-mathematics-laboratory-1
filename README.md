<h1>Introduction</h1>

This lab is meant to give you some practice with the Python programming language. Please complete the following exercises and upload your .py files under the appropriate CatCourses assignments.

<h1>Modified Hello World</h1>

Write a Python program that asks the user for his/her name, and prints out a greeting message of the form “Hello, &lt;name&gt;”, where &lt;name&gt; is the input received from the user.

<h1>Integer Classification</h1>

Write a Python program that asks the user to enter an integer. Your program should print ODD if the integer is odd, and EVEN if the integer is even. Reminder: an even integer can be represented as 2<em>x</em>, and an odd integer can be represented as 2<em>x </em>+ 1, where <em>x∈</em>Z.

<h1>More Even and Odd</h1>

Write a Python program that asks the user to enter 10 integers, and outputs the largest odd number among them. If no odd numbers were entered, your program should output a message saying: “No odd numbers were entered”.
